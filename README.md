# First College GitHub Assignment
This was my first official use of GitHub for ASU. All other homework-related repositories were removed 
and archived on my Google Drive in order to conform with ASU's academic integrity policies. This is to 
ensure that I am not held accountable if a future student attempts to turn in plagarized code when my 
private repositories eventually default to public.
